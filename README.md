## FAQ

- Due to potential anti-scraping measures on the website, crawling may fail, and manual secondary checks are required.
- The information processed by the LLM may not meet expectations; you can try optimizing the prompt content yourself.
- The content processed by the LLM may still be the template passed through the prompts, which is also caused by anti-scraping measures and requires manual secondary checks.
- Web scraping requires certain server configurations. It is recommended to purchase paid services from Zeabur and prioritize selecting U.S. nodes.
